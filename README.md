# File Encryption and Online Distributed Sharing System with Cachin’s Online Secret Splitting and Sharing
### Abstract
Basic Online Secret Sharing is a secure secret distribution where the size of the partial information that each participant should keep is the same as the original information size and no unauthorized participant has access to the information. Despite its safety, however, there are not many cases that have been applied and used in real life. Therefore, based on Cachin's theory, we made an application that can be applied to real-life. The application that we are going to make is Basic Online Secret Sharing(BOSS). BOSS is an implementation of Christian Cachin’s On-line Secret Sharing scheme. This implementation provides basic secret sharing including generation of shares and secret reconstruction using the described General Access Structure from the paper. Through this implementation, we are going to find out how the BOSS is effective and useful in our real life.
